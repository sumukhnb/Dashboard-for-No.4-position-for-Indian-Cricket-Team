This project explores cricket analytics to address a critical decision in the Indian T20 team: selecting the most suitable player for the volatile No. 4 batting position. This role demands consistency, adaptability, and strategic judgment to stabilize innings in diverse match situations.

Project Overview
The analysis focuses on three prominent players—KL Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, and Suryakumar Yadav—comparing their performances based on:
Runs scored under different conditions
Batting averages
Strike rates
Key visualizations, powered by Python, Dash, and Plotly Express, illustrate performance trends and metrics to provide a multidimensional perspective.

Key Findings
Suryakumar Yadav stands out as the ideal No. 4, exhibiting exceptional consistency, adaptability, and resilience under pressure. His performance surpasses KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer across critical metrics in the T20 format.

Tools and Methodology
Data Manipulation and Visualization: Python, Dash, Plotly Express
Analytical Methods: Comparative analysis using line charts, scatter plots, and trend analysis
Conclusion
This project not only highlights the value of data-driven decision-making in cricket but also sets a foundation for future exploration in sports analytics.

Datasets, Python code, and references are provided for transparency and collaboration.
